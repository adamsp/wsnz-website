Welcome to the home of What's Shaking, NZ? - a quake monitoring app designed for New Zealand. It is currently available on the [Windows Phone Marketplace](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-NZ/apps/8c5077db-6a9a-4c29-b095-42fea91874d9) with an Android version on the way.

Features include:

- Uses the latest [Geonet Rapid](http://beta.geonet.org.nz/quakes/felt) data feed for up-to-the-minute quake information.
- Both list and a map overviews of the latest quakes.
- Allows you to select how many quakes you'd like to see presented at once.
- And more!
