If you haven't seen it already, What's Shaking, NZ? version 1.2 for Android released recently. You can get it from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=speakman.whatsshakingnz) right now.

This version features a UI refresh, some bug fixes, device rotation support and a tablet layout!

<!-- more -->

Here is a full list of new features and bug fixes:

- Added tablet support - supporting a two-pane layout, rather than the tabbed layout which is much better suited to smaller devices, such as phones.
- Added landscape support - no longer forced to portrait on all devices! You can rotate to your hearts content.
- Added a message explaining what an earthquakes 'status' means - simply tap on the status to find out!
- Added an option to only be notified about 'reviewed' quakes (turned on by default). This fixes the bug where notifications were often showing up for 'ghost quakes' - quakes that the Geonet sensors detected, but didn't really happen, or were much smaller than initially detected as.
- Updated UI with Roboto font and better spacing for list items.
- Updated earthquake map markers to have a gradual colour change, rather than the red & blue from before.
- Upgraded to Google Maps v2. This requires Android 2.2 (FroYo) and up - if you're running Android 2.1, you can still download the old version of What's Shaking. This also requires up-to-date Google Play Services - mostly, this is updated automatically for you and you shouldn't have to worry about this!
- Fixed a bug where notifications would sometimes show up even when disabled.
