What's Shaking NZ? is an earthquake notification/monitoring application built here in New Zealand by [Adam Speakman](http://speakman.net.nz). It uses the free [Geonet](http://www.geonet.org.nz) data feeds to get the latest quakes, right on your Android or Windows Phone.

It is completely free to download on both platforms - it doesn't even have ads. It is also open-source, meaning you can look at (and contribute to!) the code that runs the application. The source code can be found on Github for both Android (Coming Soon!) and [Windows Phone](https://github.com/adamsp/wsnz-windowsphone).
